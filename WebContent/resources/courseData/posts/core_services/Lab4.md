**Slide 3**:
Prerequisites:
You must have gone through the Introduction to Cloud Computing Lab before starting this one. 

**Slide 4**:
Let us begin with a brief introduction: 

Keystone is the identity service in charge of providing authentication and authorization to access the openstack services. Horizon, which is the OpenStack dashboard project, it is a canonical representation that allows you to access the openstack services like Nova, Neutron, Swift, Keystone through a web based user interface. It allows the admin and other users to access and manage the functional components using just a web browser.

The Horizon dashboard supports 3 types of central dashboards. These are: 
User Dashboard
System Dashboard
Settings Dashboard of all the core openstack projects

Using these, the core openstack projects are supported and delivered.

It has an Extensible feature as the user can customize the dashboard with new components that are related to the projects. 
The code base is simple, easy to navigate as every file is programmed  with the required logic and arranged in a modular manner such that the files are easily correlated with navigation, making it a lot Manageable.
There is Consistency across the application with respect to the visual paradigm and interaction paradigm by accessing a solid set of reusable templates, the required core classes on which the changes are made and also additional tools such as base widget classes, form classes, etc)
The Horizon Dashboard is also Stable. The use of core classes and reusable templates creates an implicit requirement that there has to be backward compatibility in case of a change.


## Horizon Dashboard

Now let us get familiarised with Horizon Dashboard:

As we have discussed before,  keystone OpenStack’s identity service. The authentication and authorization can be done using a combination of users, roles, tenants or projects and domain.

The default OpenStack users are admin and demo. Also, the default tenants are admin and demo. Since admin user has an admin role, it can have control over admin tenant and demo tenant; on the other hand, demo user can only have access to demo tenant. In addition to the default user and tenants names, the default password that we have given to both of these users is secrete.

Let us start our hand-on activities by showing you how to access the Horizon Dashboard.

### Accessing the Horizon Dashboard
To access the horizon dashboard, type the IP address on your browser bar. Provide the credentials to the login page:

Username: admin
Password: secrete and then click connect button.


 
Now let us begin familiarizing with Horizon Dashboard. 

We will start with Services.
### Services
Within the horizon dashboard, the service list can be found in system information. The navigation is: 

Admin → System→ System Information

The system information table has the information like service Name, the openstack service to which it is associated with, host address and the status -  whether it is enabled or disabled.
### Tenants
A Tenant is another term for a project. It represents a group of users who have dedicated access to their compute resources. 
#### List Tenant
List tenant will provide you with a list of the currently available tenants / projects.

You can find the list of tenants within the admin project. The navigation is: 

In Admin→ Identity → Projects→ the list of tenants can be found here.

Let us now see the procedure to create a tenant.
#### Create Tenant	

To create a tenant, click on the Create Project button on top right corner of the screen. 

In the project information tab, provide project name, description. In the project members tab, click on the + sign located next to each user to provide users access to this new tenant. In the Quota tab, check  if the default values are the ones that you require and click on Create project button. 

The  ‘Success: Created new project <project name>’ message confirms the successful creation of your project. Now you will get to see the newly created project among the project list. 

#### Delete Tenant

To delete a tenant, you need to first check the box next to the project name that you wish to delete. 





Click on Delete Project button to delete the project that you checked in the previous step.

The pop up box that appears will now ask you to confirm the name of the tenant/project that you wish to delete. Confirm the deletion of the tenant by clicking on the Delete Project option. 

Let us see the procedure to edit a tenant now.

#### Edit Tenant
To edit a tenant, click on the drop down icon towards the right side of the screen. Click on ‘Edit Project’ to edit the project details.

 There are 3 tabs available within Edit Tenant: Project Information, Project Members and Quota that can be edited. 
In project information, the project name, description and the enabled property can be edited.  

In Project Members, you can add members using the + icon beside every user. The save button beneath the dialog box can be used to save the changes. 

In Quota tab, the related fields can be edited and saved using the save button. 


### Users and Roles
#### Create User
